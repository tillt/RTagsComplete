## RTagsComplete 0.5.2
======================

### A N N O U N C E M E N T

This pre-release gets us mostly smaller fixes and an updated README including
links to the all new [Wiki](https://github.com/tillt/RTagsComplete/wiki).

The next TODO's are more unit-tests helping to increase the long-term quality
level needed for a reliable developer tool.

Despite that, there are actually no real plans for more functions. Once all of
the current functions are reliably usable, it will be a 1.0.0.

Need to start tracking the known issues.
