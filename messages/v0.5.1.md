---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### C H A N G E L O G

#### Enhancement:

- Added a couple of meaningful unit tests - still plenty more to do.
- Added 'staticmethod' to kind extensions to symbol-info.
- Added custom symbol-info popup filtering based on the new 'filtered_clang_cursor_kind' flag.

#### Fix:

- Fixes killing jobs that may be gone already.
- Makes sure that a hover makes the underlying view be in focus - important for the status display relevance.
- Makes sure that a hover on an unsupported view silently fails early.

#### README:

- Added 'filtered_clang_cursor_kind' flag.
